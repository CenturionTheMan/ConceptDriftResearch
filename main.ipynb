    "The overall approach ensures that the impact of demographic feature distributions (like sex) on model performance is explicitly studied. By carefully controlling the sampling ratios in training and testing datasets, it enables fair comparisons and insights into potential biases or generalization challenges in the classification of skin lesion images."
